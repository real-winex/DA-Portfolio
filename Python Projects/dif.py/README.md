Your Instructions 

Write a script named dif.py. 
This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files and compare 
the contents of the two files to see if they are the same. 
If they are, the script should simply output "Yes". If they are not, 
the script should output "No", followed by the first lines of each file that 
differ from each other. The input loop should read and compare lines from each file. 
The loop should break as soon as a pair of different lines is found.
