Your Tasks

Modify the guessing-game program of Section 3.5 in the file guess.py 
so that the user thinks of a number that the computer must guess. 
The computer must make no more than the minimum number of guesses, 
and it must prevent the user from cheating by entering misleading hints.

Hint: Use the math.log function to compute the minimum number of guesses 
needed after the lower and upper bounds are entered.
