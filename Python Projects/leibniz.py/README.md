Your Tasks

The German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz developed the 
following method to approximate the value of 
π: π/4 = 1 – 1/3 + 1/5 – 1/7 + . . .

Write a program in the file leibniz.py that allows the user to
specify the number of iterations used in this approximation and that 
displays the resulting value. 

Instructions

Task 1: Write the leibniz.py program that allows the user to specify 
the number of iterations used in this approximation and that displays 
the resulting value.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter the number of iterations: 5

The approximation of pi is 3.3396825396825403
