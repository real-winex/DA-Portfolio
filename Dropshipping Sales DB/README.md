I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive sales overview for a dropshipping business, integrating SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and calculations. The dashboard featured year and month filters, sales breakdowns by top customers and products, and key performance metrics. I designed the database structure, connected tables, created measures, and built insightful visualizations, ensuring a polished and user-friendly analytical tool for sales performance tracking.
