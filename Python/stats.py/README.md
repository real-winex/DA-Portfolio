Your Tasks

A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a
set of functions that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, 
as defined in Section 5.4.Define these functions in a module named stats.py.
Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
Each function should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single 
number. Each function should return 0 if the list is empty.
Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions with a given list. 

Instructions

Task 1: Define the mean function.
Task 2: Define the mode function.
Task 3: Define the median function.
