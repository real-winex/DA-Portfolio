Your Task 

Write a script named numberlines.py. 
This script creates a program listing from a source program. 
This script should prompt the user for the names of two files. 
The input filename could be the name of the script itself, 
but be careful to use a different output filename!
The script copies the lines of text from the input file to the output file,
numbering each line as it goes. 
The line numbers should be right-justified in four columns, 
so that the format of a line in the output file looks like this example:

1> This is the first line of text.
