Your Tasks

A standard science experiment is to drop a ball and see how high it bounces. 
Once the “bounciness” of the ball has been determined, the ratio gives a bounciness
index.

For example, if a ball dropped from a height of 10 feet bounces 6 feet high,
the index is 0.6, and the total distance traveled by the ball is 16 feet after 
one bounce. If the ball were to continue bouncing, 
the distance after two bounces would be 10 ft + 6 ft + 6 ft + 3.6 ft = 25.6 ft.
Note that the distance traveled for each successive bounce is the distance to the 
floor plus 0.6 of that distance as the ball comes back up.

Write a program in the file bouncy.py that lets the user enter the 
initial height from which the ball is dropped, the bounciness index of the ball,
and the number of times it is allowed to continue bouncing. 
Output should be the total distance traveled by the ball. 

Instructions

Task 1: Write the bouncy.py program calculates the 
total distance traveled by the ball.


An example of the program is shown below:

Enter the height from which the ball is dropped: 25

Enter the bounciness index of the ball: .5

Enter the number of times the ball is allowed to continue bouncing: 3

Total distance traveled is: 65.625 units.
