  I designed and developed a comprehensive Excel dashboard to analyze a pizza company's sales performance, incorporating SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and calculations. The dashboard featured key metrics, hourly order trends, and best/worst-selling pizzas, supported by six pivot tables and dynamic data visualizations. I structured the database, defined KPIs, and applied polished formatting to ensure clarity and usability, delivering a complete and insightful sales analysis tool.
